		<p class="lead">Website underway...</p>	
		<p>The purpose of this website is to practice coding which I've been doing for over 12 years as a Frontend Developer and get into a routine of blogging.</p>

		<h2>A bit about me...</h2>
		<h3>Developer at heart</h3>
		<p class="lead">I'm a 35 year old senior manager at <a href="http://www.ph-creative.com" target="_blank">Ph.Creative</a> from Liverpool.</p>
		<p>Since April 2014, I've been responsible for the web development team at Ph.Creative.<br /> 
		I started my career at Ph. in April 2008 as a Frontend Developer before becoming Senior Frontend Developer 4 years later.</p>
		<p>Before that, I spent 5 years at <a href="http://www.rapid.co.uk" target="_blank">Rapid Technologies</a> as their sole web designer and developer responsible for maintaining their company website.</p>
		<p>My experience spans multiple disciplines having worked closely with Backend Developers, Designer, UX/UI Designers, Project Managers even Finance but my main passion is HTML and CSS, delivering websites and leading a great team.</p>

		<h3>Home life</h3>
		<p>When I'm not living the fast pace of agency life I spend all my time with my other half and Son. Rachel and I have been together for 16 years, married in 2011 and had our first child James in 2012 with another one on the way!</p> 
		<p>We've spent all our lives in Liverpool both growing up in Norris Green before we bought our previous home in Anfield 11 years ago. Our adventures take us to Crosby next with a completion on our second home just around the corner.</p>

		<h3>Everyone needs a hobby</h3>
		<p>I'm a Liverpool FC supporter and until recently ran a Sunday League Football Club for 6 years. Managing a group of lads on a cold Sunday morning with one or two looking worse for wear from the night before makes my role at Ph. look like a breeze!</p>
		<p>I played Lead Guitar in rock/indie band called 'Iconoclast' for about 8 years. I took it pretty seriously but fell out of love with the whole thing and decided one day to just put the guitar down having signed a management deal and recorded an album. Music is still important to me and still go the occasional gig.</p>
		<p>I love <a href="https://letterboxd.com/jamesicon/films/" target="_blank">watching films</a> as well as TV box sets, having a few beers at the weekend and worshipping the sunshine.</p>
